## JIRA Action Plugin

![images_community/download/attachments/27099341/icon.png](images_community/download/attachments/27099341/icon.png) The **JIRA Action plugin** integrates dynaTrace in your exisiting JIRA ticketing
system. The plugin creates a new JIRA Issue for Alerts triggered by dynaTrace and includes detailed information about the Incident in the created JIRA Ticket.

This plugin is a showcase plugin to better understand how to build custom action plugins for dynaTrace.  
A detailed [Step-By-Step Guide explains how to build a plugin like this](https://community.compuwareapm.com/community/display/DOCDT42/Developing+a+User+Plugin). The implementation of this plugin can easily be changed to create
tickets in other ticketing systems such as Bugzilla, Trac, etc.
